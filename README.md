# Advanced Prompt Generator

![Banner Image Placeholder](path/to/banner-image)

## Overview
This project is an **LLM-based Advanced Prompt Generator** designed to automate the process of prompt engineering by enhancing given input prompts using large language models (LLMs). Following established prompt engineering principles, the tool can generate advanced prompts with a simple click, leveraging LLM agents for optimized prompt generation.

The tool is deployed using **FastAPI** and **Docker** with an interactive testing interface created using **Gradio** and hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

## Key Features
- **LLM-Based Prompt Enhancement:** Utilizes `gpt-4o` /or `gpt-4o-mini` models for generating advanced prompts.
- **Automated Prompt Engineering:** Simplifies prompt engineering processes, requiring minimal user input.
- **FastAPI & Docker Deployment:** Ensures efficient and scalable backend deployment.
- **Gradio Interface:** Provides an easy-to-use interface for testing the prompt generation.
- **Hugging Face Integration:** Hosted on Hugging Face Spaces for public access.

## Next Steps
- **Optimize Solution Architecture:** Improve cost efficiency, reduce latency, and enhance stability and reproducibility (currently in progress).
- **Expand Model Support:** Integrate additional models to offer more variety and flexibility.
